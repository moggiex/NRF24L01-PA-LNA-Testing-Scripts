# Arduino NRF24L01+PA+LNA Testing Scripts

If you've purchased the a pair (or more) of the NRF24L01+PA+LNA transceivers , there is a lot of **old example code out there that does not work anymore** (as of 2016) and this drove me nuts.

The standard RF24 "Getting Started" scripts that comes with the RF24 library are hardly newbie proof, these are much, much easier to use & get started quickly with (ie what I needed originally!).

**This code will help you get you up & running *fast* !!!**

# You will need:

1. Two Arduino's that use 3.3V (I'm using Pro Mini's)
2. The RF24 library which can be downloaded here https://github.com/tmrh20/RF24/ (add to your libraries, restart etc...)
3. And of course two NRF24L01+PA+LNA or nRF24L01+ boards
4. The Arduino IDE - https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
5. And I'd **strongly** suggest using a dedicated 3.3V supply as Arduino's don't have anough current capacity to power these devices

**Note: #5 - A Separate 3.3V Power Supply**

LM1117T chips are what I'm using to supply 3.3V to the nRF24L01+ boards. They're cheap & simple to wire up with just two capacitors. See here for the diagram http://circuits.datasheetdir.com/40/LM1117-circuits.jpg just make sure you put the GND wire on both the nRF24L01+ board  **AND** connect the GND from the 3.3 supply to the Arduino GND too.

# Wiring the Arduino's

See the image below:

![NRF24L01+PA+LNA pin layout](https://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/file/view/24L01Pinout-800.jpg/243330999/24L01Pinout-800.jpg)

This is the top view of the pins, so make sure you get them the right way around :)

Connect your pins as detailed below, noting this is for Arduino Pro Mini's. If you're using a different board quickly google the board name and "pin out" to make sure you you get the right pins for SCK, MOSI & MSIO (I believe they are different on a MEGA board for example).

```
Pin 1 - Ground to Ground
Pin 2 - VCC to your 3.3V supply
Pin 3 - CE (somtimes called SS) to pin 9
Pin 4 - CSN to pin 10
Pin 5 - SCK to pin 13
Pin 6 - MOSI to pin 11
Pin 7 - MISO to pin 12
Pin 8 - Unused (it's an interupt)
```

# nRF24L01+ Test Script Time!

**Do not skip this step.**  Skipping it will only mean you loose more hair from your head :/

Download the script called "Start_with_this_testing_script.ino" from above as this script **is your biggest friend** when starting with nRF24L01+ boards.

1. Copy & paste this script into your Arduino IDE
2. Compile & upload to your board
3. Open the COM window
4. Set the COM window to "9600 baud"
 
If everything goes well, you will know that you have wired the nRF24L01+ & Arduino up correct if you see a message like the one below, you'll see values such as "0x3f" and "0x02", **not "0xff"** which are bad.

```c
STATUS		 = 0x0e RX_DR=0 TX_DS=0 MAX_RT=0 RX_P_NO=7 TX_FULL=0
RX_ADDR_P0-1	 = 0x3130303030 0xe8e8f0f0e1
RX_ADDR_P2-5	 = 0xc3 0xc4 0xc5 0xc6
TX_ADDR		 = 0x3130303030
RX_PW_P0-6	 = 0x20 0x20 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
EN_AA		 = 0x3f
EN_RXADDR	 = 0x02
RF_CH		 = 0x4c
RF_SETUP	 = 0x21
CONFIG		 = 0x0f
DYNPD/FEATURE	 = 0x00 0x00
Data Rate	 = 250KBPS
Model		 = nRF24L01+
CRC Length	 = 16 bits
PA Power	 = PA_MIN
```

And if the nRF24L01+ is wired up **incorrectly**, then you'll see a message like the one below. See the differences!

```c
STATUS		 = 0x00 RX_DR=0 TX_DS=0 MAX_RT=0 RX_P_NO=0 TX_FULL=0
RX_ADDR_P0-1	 = 0xffffffffff 0xffffffffff
RX_ADDR_P2-5	 = 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff
TX_ADDR		 = 0xffffffffff
RX_PW_P0-6	 = 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff
EN_AA		 = 0xff
EN_RXADDR	 = 0xff
RF_CH		 = 0xff
RF_SETUP	 = 0xff
CONFIG		 = 0xff
DYNPD/FEATURE	 = 0xff 0xff
Data Rate	 = 1MBPS
Model		 = nRF24L01
CRC Length	 = 16 bits
PA Power	 = PA_MAX
```

If you don't see an output like the first example then check your wiring etc... and also the "nRF24L01+ not working?" section below.

Don't be tempted to skip this step, confirm the nRF24L01+ boards are working first, before continuing.

# nRF24L01+ Let's Send Some Data!

**You're ready to rock now!**

1. Download the [Transmitter.ino](https://github.com/moggiex/NRF24L01-PA-LNA-Testing-Scripts/blob/master/Transmitter.ino)
2. Upload this to the first Arduino
3. Download the [Receiver.ino](https://github.com/moggiex/NRF24L01-PA-LNA-Testing-Scripts/blob/master/Receiver.ino)
4. Upload this to the second Arduino
5. Set the baud rate to 9600 on the COM windows
6. One of them is transmitting the message  "Hello world! " and the current milli() time.
7. And the other is receiving that message

These scripts are a simplfied and well document versions of what I've been using to test with. 

# nRF24L01+ not working?

Here are some daft things to check.

1. Arduino UNO's normally run on 5V, nRF24L01+ **need 3.3V**. So either use a difefrent board (eg Pro mini at 3.3V) or a logic conversion board (they're around Â£1 each and saves you frying the nRF24L01+ with too much voltage) and the standard 3.3V pin on an UNO isn't up to powering a nRF24L01+!!!
2. Solder a 10uF and a 0.1uF capacitor directly to the VCC and GND pins on the nRF24L01+ board (gives the board a little extra power when transmitting)
3. Check your wiring 
4. Check your wiring
4. Check your wiring again!! (this was the cause to a lot of my issues to begin with)
5. Use a dedicated 3.3V supply for the nRF24L01+ board and make sure the ground pins are joined between the 3.3V supply & the arduino board

# Hope this helps you!
I spent ages faffing around with other test scripts and making silly mistakes. I genuinely hope these simplified examples helps you!
